## Hello!

Mittz bot was created with the intentions of supporting My [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/zzthRpu), but it had come to my attention that it can amount up to way more than just a private use bot

Every community is unique. Vanilla is a finely-crafted platform on which designers and developers
can build a custom-tailored environment that meets your community's particular needs.

## Why Mittz-Bot is one of the better of the bunch.

1. Custom Server Moderation with swear filters, custom welcome, and command channels.
1. I can also create profile cards with ease.
1. Simple economy for users to interact with.
1. The best tools available for community management.
1. Curated features with great plugin options, not the kitchen sink.
